Approach to Market
To establish Contract for Quality and Technical Assurance Group for the Climate Resilient Communities Program
Reference ID: DFAT - 1066
UNSPSC: 80100000 Management Advisory Services
This Approach to Market (ATM) is for the provision of: A Quality Technical and Assurance Group (QTAG), comprising a small team of experts, is required to provide independent advice to DFAT on the Climate Resilient Communities (CRC) program, in support of accountability and learning.   

The purpose of the QTAG is: 
- Accountability: To provide independent support, advice and reporting to DFAT (the CRC Secretariat) on the performance of the CRC program. 
- Learning: To improve the performance of the CRC program by fostering learning and adaptation in DFAT, the CRC Support Unit and CRC implementing partners. 

The CRC is a five-year investment (2024-29) with the option to extend a further four years, with a current value of $221.9m million. It is designed to deliver impact so that people in the Indo-Pacific are more resilient to climate change and disasters.  

CRC will contribute to this goal by achieving two End-of-Facility Outcomes (EoFOs):   
- Indo-Pacific partner governments have taken gender-responsive and inclusive actions that strengthen climate and disaster resilience, particularly in the water, food and energy sectors.   
- Indo-Pacific development partners have implemented gender-responsive, inclusive and locally led programs and partnerships that strengthen climate and disaster resilience, particularly in the water, food and energy sectors. 

The EoFOs are being delivered through six workstreams, providing: co-funding for programs; program cycle (design, implementation and monitoring and review) support; climate integration and disaster risk reduction technical assistance; mobilising additional climate finance; sharing of lessons learnt and public diplomacy.  

The CRC is comprised of a Support Unit (managed by a Contractor), the Secretariat (DFAT staff), a Steering Committee, and the QTAG.    
The Commonwealth of Australia as represented by Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (the Customer) is seeking submissions for the provision of the services (the Requirement) as described in this ATM comprising:

Proposed Contract


A.A.2	The Requirement
A Quality Technical and Assurance Group (QTAG), comprising a small team of experts, is required to provide independent advice to DFAT on the Climate Resilient Communities (CRC) program.    
 DFAT requires the QTAG to: 
Undertake an independent annual assessment of the CRC’s performance against the CRC Performance Assessment Framework.  
A separate statement of work for the annual assessment will be agreed each year. The annual assessment will however typically include advice and reporting on the efficacy and efficiency of CRC technical assistance, MEL systems and reporting processes, and governance arrangement and the extent to which these support the successful implementation of the program as outlined in the CRC design..  
The annual assessments will typically also include analysis of the extent to which CRC reporting systems are supporting DFAT to meet its development performance and quality reporting obligations (for example, the Tier 2 indicators in the Performance and Delivery Framework).  
In undertaking the annual assessment, the QTAG may be asked to review CRC technical assistance products, designs, PAFs, performance reports, IMRs and PPAs for co-funded programs to ensure CRC is on track towards its EOFOs and IOs.  
In undertaking the annual assessment, the QTAG may be asked to undertake deep dives into CRC workstreams to support learning and adaptation.  
This assessment will inform DFAT’s Investment Monitoring Report process and as such will be submitted to DFAT (the CRC Secretariat) by 28 February every year. 
This assessment will likely include travel to at least one sample country or region per year, as agreed with DFAT (CRC Secretariat and Posts). 
Act as a ‘critical friend’ to CRC to understand what is working, what is not, why and what can be done to build on CRC’s strengths and address performance issues. This may include, but is not limited to: 
Reviewing annual CRC workplans and assessing whether there is a clear and plausible pathway between the plans and CRC expected outcomes.  
Leading an annual strategy testing workshop and regular informal catch ups with the CRC Secretariat and Support Unit Contractor to discuss: 
CRC progress against outcomes - what is working and what is not,  
Emerging opportunities and risks  
CRC partner communications and ways of working. 
Reviewing and assessing governance structures and ways of working for the CRC Secretariat, Steering Committee and CRC Support Unit (CRCSU), advising on issues and potential improvements to support CRC delivery. 
Reviewing draft Investment Monitoring Reports. This may include the IMR for CRC and/ or select CRC co-funded investments, as agreed with DFAT. 
Reviewing the CRC program logic and MEL framework to ensure they remain fit to achieve the goals, objectives and outcomes of the program. 
Conduct ‘deep dive’ performance and/or learning reviews on partners, programs, or thematic or program management topics (to be defined in implementation).  
Contribute to learning events managed by the CRC Support Unit or Posts, for example, as a speaker or by contributing learning publication content.  
Support the CRC Secretariat to develop and manage mid-term and end of program evaluations, and thematic reviews. 
Deliver other tasks, as directed by the CRC Secretariat. 

Deliverables, Milestones and Reporting 
As the QTAG will be responsive to the needs of the CRC Secretariat, deliverables, milestones and reporting will be discussed and agreed in writing in the Annual Workplan between the CRC Secretariat and the QTAG, following the Annual Planning Process.  
Through an Annual Planning Process, DFAT and the QTAG will draft an Annual Workplan which details the QTAG’s specific activities and work for the coming year. This will be agreed between DFAT and the QTAG. Any changes will be discussed and jointly agreed in writing. Outside of the Annual Planning Process, DFAT and the QTAG may also agree, through individual tasking notes, to additional tasks in order to respond to ad hoc requests from DFAT (the CRC Secretariat and/or Posts). 
The only fixed annual deliverable will be an Annual Program Performance and Learning Report which is to be submitted by 28 February every year (unless otherwise agreed). The Report will be informed by the QTAG’s annual independent assessment of the CRC against the CRC Performance Assessment Framework. (see ‘Scope of Work’ 1. above). 
The format and contents of the Annual Program Performance and Learning Report will be discussed and agreed annually with the CRC Secretariat.

Document: DFAT 1066 - Approach to Market CRC QTAG - Final.docx



Approach to Market
To establish Contract for Quality and Technical Assurance Group for the Climate Resilient Communities Program
Reference ID: DFAT - 1066
UNSPSC: 80100000 Management Advisory Services
This Approach to Market (ATM) is for the provision of: A Quality Technical and Assurance Group (QTAG), comprising a small team of experts, is required to provide independent advice to DFAT on the Climate Resilient Communities (CRC) program, in support of accountability and learning.   

The purpose of the QTAG is: 
- Accountability: To provide independent support, advice and reporting to DFAT (the CRC Secretariat) on the performance of the CRC program. 
- Learning: To improve the performance of the CRC program by fostering learning and adaptation in DFAT, the CRC Support Unit and CRC implementing partners. 

The CRC is a five-year investment (2024-29) with the option to extend a further four years, with a current value of $221.9m million. It is designed to deliver impact so that people in the Indo-Pacific are more resilient to climate change and disasters.  

CRC will contribute to this goal by achieving two End-of-Facility Outcomes (EoFOs):   
- Indo-Pacific partner governments have taken gender-responsive and inclusive actions that strengthen climate and disaster resilience, particularly in the water, food and energy sectors.   
- Indo-Pacific development partners have implemented gender-responsive, inclusive and locally led programs and partnerships that strengthen climate and disaster resilience, particularly in the water, food and energy sectors. 

The EoFOs are being delivered through six workstreams, providing: co-funding for programs; program cycle (design, implementation and monitoring and review) support; climate integration and disaster risk reduction technical assistance; mobilising additional climate finance; sharing of lessons learnt and public diplomacy.
