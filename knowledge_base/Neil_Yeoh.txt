Professional Summary
My life's purpose is to help those who feel stuck get unstuck - unlocking your gifts to their fullest potential and for the greatest good. I started working in oil & gas feeling stuck with little purpose & belief in change, but now work on climate with conviction to manifest the change I want to see in the world.
Born into an immigrant family in a small town of Australia, I grew up struggling to find purpose and to believe I could change my circumstances. My parents sacrificed so my siblings and I could have a better life, but I felt convicted to do more with my life despite not knowing where to start.
Through developing the right skillsets and receiving proper guidance, I transformed from being stuck in oil & gas to finding purpose in the climate movement. These same principles helped me grow in other areas:
	•	From a serial procrastinator with concentration issues to finding deep focus
	•	From being diagnosed with a heart murmur to completing a full ironman
	•	From being an average B+ student in English to writing articles for Forbes & WEF
	•	From subpar grades at a local university to attending dream UK & US schools
	•	From being a corporate worker in my 20s to a first-time founder in my 30s
I believe all individuals can unlock their own "good growth" - regardless of their situation - and grow into their untapped potential and capacity to do good.
