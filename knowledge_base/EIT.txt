	1	EARTHBASE AND OUR EXPERTISE
Earthbase is an advisory firm set up in 2023 to help sustainability-focused players across the food system commercialise faster and on a greater scale. A strategic supplier to EIT Food, we are headquartered in the UK with a network of associate experts and partners across Europe and the Americas from which we assemble the best teams and deploy into global and European agrifood, technology and public sector organisations in several key areas, notably commercial strategy, Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy & modelling, startup / SME / Corporate innovation economics, partnering methods, training, team resourcing, and sales execution.
Earthbase will be partnering with OnePointFive (OPF) to deliver this project. OPF is a leading Climate Advisory and Training firm and has successfully collaborated with Earthbase for several years. OPF works with organisations including midsize to large-cap companies, multinational nonprofits, and climate technology startup solutions, located across Europe, US and Asia Pacific. OPF has extensive experience partnering with global development organisations & agricultural standards bodies, as well as global startups, regenerative agriculture initiatives, and international financing groups looking to maximise impact.
In the past 2 years, we have collectively provided services to over 50 agrifood and climate startups, SMEs, corporates, accelerators, agencies, and VCs including CGAIR, Agricarbon, Barry Callebaut, Wiliot, Tech Nation, EIT Food, OECD, Agrimetrics, Sustained.com, and Oxera.
Combined, we are experts in:
	•	Understanding, evaluating and rating the commercial viability of startups and SME innovation and their proposals' commercial value / target / timeline viability. In turn this provides EIT Food with more robust contract term sheets per project
	•	Financial modelling and tooling to evaluate, plan and deliver the most appropriate mechanisms for maximising the commercial efficacy of the programme and individual projects
	•	Cost-effective, high-quality project management, monitoring, and iteration, tailored to EIT Food's goals
	•	The agrifood innovation ecosystem across Europe and globally
EIT Food has a well-deserved reputation for driving a healthier, resilient and decarbonised food system. Earthbase's experts and partners are committed to generate both tangible deliverables and measurable outcomes in this programme which in turn will attract and propel innovation across the food system, ultimately contributing to sustainable organisational and systemic change. The strategies & insights, modelling structures, and due diligence processes developed through our work will inform and constitute a baseline for integrated developments with EIT Food.
	2	APPROACH
OVERVIEW: EIT Food's Impact Funding Framework (IFF) seeks to mobilise €30m, over 3 years, of concessionary capital towards social, environmental, and innovation challenges within the global food system. The programme funds initial cheques of €250k with follow-on funding up to €1m, for a consortium of organisations or a single project focused on an innovative food idea (Source: EIT Food).
This is part of EIT Food's overarching three-pronged mission of bringing healthier lives through food, a Net Zero food system, and reducing risk for a fair and resilient food system (EIT Food), focusing on important priority advancements in regenerative agriculture, labelling, packaging & transparency, and protein diversification. The programme prioritises involvement with other mission-driven programmes, projects, & organisations and seeks to structure its engagements using a proprietary Success Sharing Mechanism (SSM). The next outcomes of the IFF and SSM will include the analysis of the funding candidates applying across the three funding windows through to the end of 2025, where each round includes roughly 10-15 consortium-based projects, 50 participants, 8-10 term-sheet agreements (high-level commercial due diligence will be expected for 5-7 projects). Furthermore, an improved financing model will be required for a new Impact Funding Programme, the foundations of which will be undertaken in this programme of work. Commercial due diligence and resulting modelling will also be fed into the new Fast Track to Market program, introduced in 2025.
CHALLENGES: EIT Food's IFF European Commission-originated funding has legacy funding requirements and limits the type of innovation funding (neither debt, nor equity), and 'intellectual property recovery' clauses in the event the enterprise fails as part of the SSM. These requirements complicate an innovation-first, startup-friendly model of funding which can throttle the innovation ecosystem and work counterproductively with startups in the Food & Agriculture sector.
Specifically, initial briefing discussions and materials have highlighted that:
	•	The SSM payback mechanism is linear, with milestones at month 3 and month 15, meaning that this disadvantages commercialisation of non-linear hard- climate technology innovation within the Agrifood space (e.g. Protein Diversification)
	•	The SSM payback mechanism is not aligned to common reporting cycles, meaning that investees will need to prepare audited or unaudited financials off-cycle, increasing compliance cost and reducing likelihood to comply
	•	Clauses such as "Intellectual Property Recovery" complicate the investment terms by adding more liability to the company, meaning that future investors will take on additional liability and reduce investment attractiveness
	•	The difficulty in managing trade-offs between consistency in deal structures, comparability of different revenue models, ability to forecast early-stage revenue growth and deal terms that accurately manage risk and return, means that negotiations are protracted and unstandardised.
As part of this engagement team's lived experience, having collectively founded and operated 3+ companies, ran diligence on 2000+ startups, invested in ~70 companies, and successfully navigated investment rounds from seed to Series A, the above challenges need to be urgently addressed in order to improve both the quality and quantity of the innovation pipeline, the success-sharing of funds post-investment, and the overarching three-pronged mission of EIT Food.

	4	METHODOLOGY FOR PROGRAMME DELIVERABLES & OUTCOMES
This section details our methodology we will undertake for this project, as well as a detailed breakdown of programme deliverables and outcomes.
We have embedded key principles and design considerations, based on our investing and operating experience, as well as our research at Yale University's Center for Business and Environment (CBEY) on investing in nascent climate technologies.
We will integrate through our project methodology and approach, where possible, by:
	•	Improving collaboration and coordination among investors across multiple stages of technology development and investment type
	•	Derisking the multiple innovation "valleys of death", through providing industry connections for pilots, or investors securing sufficient upstream or downstream pipeline investment for follow-on funding through leveraging corporate-partnership ecosystems (e.g. EIT Food's ecosystem partners, Circulate Capital's model)
	•	Reducing complexity of deploying non-traditional investment tools, thereby reducing the amount of time to sign deal terms
	•	Using standardised tools and methodology supported by the latest climate science, as well as emissions databases- e.g. CRANE Tool, Project Frame Forward-looking emissions modelling, KOI by Rho AI and Ecoinvent for Life-Cycle Assessment
	•	Tailoring the payback period to the maturity of the company, considering valuation or annual revenue generation thresholds
	•	Embedding founder & startup-friendly principles, considering the nature of nascent, deep-tech, especially for overlapping agrifood areas in protein diversification (e.g. molecular biology), packaging & textiles (e.g. advanced materials science), and regenerative agriculture (e.g. soil testing & agronomy, satellite mapping)
	•	Integrating a holistic investment approach by understanding how the new candidates' innovations complement existing portfolio
The above list is non-exhaustive but presents a starting foundation for best practice.
The following table lists the expected deliverables from the phases detailed in Section 3 Programme Structure above, integrating best practice principles. Deliverable output timing can be adjusted as needed for internal process development.

These resourcing and tooling inputs, combined with our past experiences in financial analysis and funding applicant review, have crystallised the below table, as the initial set of parameters we will use to drive early due diligence. These principles and evaluation processes can be mobilised from input tools to a working IFF-driven structure within days of project activation.
Table: Commercial Due Diligence Process used to assess Candidates' Proposals
Area: Viability of Candidate's GTM Strategy
Market Analysis Variables Evaluated:
	•	Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), Service Obtainable Market (SOM) with timeframe
	•	Competitive Landscape Measurement Process:
	•	Use Earthbase's + EIT Food's Startup Evaluation methods to benchmark and score each startup based on these business fundamentals
	•	Assign a weighted score based on key success factors
	•	Set a threshold score (e.g., 70/100) to determine if a startup qualifies for funding based on GTM
	•	Feed into Section "Overall Financial Viability" (see below) Benchmarking:
	•	TAM estimated based on industry reports
	•	SAM adjusted for realistic penetration rates
	•	Competitor analysis based on latest market trends
Customer Definition Variables Evaluated:
	•	Target Customer Segment

	•	Operational capacity Benchmarking:
	•	Increase investment in GTM hiring and training
	•	Expand operational capacity with supply chain partners
Overall Financial Viability
Financial Health Projection of the applicant (A Startup/ SME's ability to meet repayment targets depends on how realistic their revenue projections are) Variables Evaluated:
	•	Existing financial burn rate / planned runway
	•	Income profile
	•	Investment profile
	•	Breakeven and profitability check & timeframe
	•	Cash Flow & Loan Repayment capability Measurement Process: Following GTM evaluation (as an input to Overall Financial Viability): Conduct Financial Projection Accuracy Check:
	•	Compare startup's revenue projections for Years 1-5 with industry benchmarks.
	•	Use historical data, if available, or market growth rates to validate assumptions
	•	Adjust projected revenue using a risk-adjusted discount rate (e.g., reducing projections by 20%-30% if assumptions seem overly optimistic) Conduct Breakeven & Profitability Check:
	•	Calculate the breakeven point (fixed costs ÷ gross margin %) considering consortia relationship or single entity
	•	Assess expected profitability: Net income = Revenue – Expenses: If the startup remains unprofitable beyond 3 years, repayment viability is questionable Conduct Cash Flow & Loan Repayment Test:
	•	Map expected cash flow to repayment schedule
	•	Ensure the entities have enough projected free cash flow (FCF) combined to cover repayment phases, e.g.
o Year 1-2: Cash reserves / existing investment should cover the first 10% repayment
o Year 3-4: Existing Investment Profitability should support the next 20% repayment
o Year 5: Sustainable operations should ensure the final 70% repayment
Benchmarking: As required

C. LONGER TERM MODELLING INNOVATION FROM EARTHBASE
A. MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK
To ensure that this project is both effective and impactful, we propose a Measurement Framework that tracks progress, ensures alignment with the programme's objectives, and evaluates the long-term benefits of the financial instruments.
From the outset, we will align to EIT Food's KPIs, to measure success and refine the programme in real time through all stages and final review, ensuring we are driven by outcomes and the work remains relevant to organisational goals.
This will include:

Outcome-based design: Ensuring the programme is tailored to meet the needs and goals of participants.
Easy to understand and use financial modelling tools to assess commercial capability of any applicant, and where best the applicant fits in the scheme.
Term-sheet construction: present and test incremental changes to the existing mechanisms-pricing model, segmentation, payback horizons/terms, ROI terms etc by analysing and integrating prior customers and financing mechanism success in each instance. Build / revise existing terms based on deeper understanding of the commercial status of each applicant and their proposal
Evaluating ROI across all investments past and future, to identify successful characteristics and to tune SSM and financial model mechanics
Periodic review with EIT Food to ensure that KPIs are aligning with focus areas and providing insights beyond returns and overall financial performance

B. EXAMPLES OF RELEVANT WORK / PROJECTS

C. LONGER TERM INNOVATION FROM EARTHBASE
Advanced innovation funding and collaboration decision-making
Earthbase sees huge potential for EIT Food, in their position as system thinkers looking at food system impact through multiple points of innovation, to be able to model and analyse multi-dimensional economic, financial and environmental systems as a way to produce competitively-advantageous funding decisions across their for the SSM/IFF mechanisms, plus provide data-driven decisions on other critical aspects of their business, such as partner selection, programme co-development, and international expansion strategy.
EIT Food, like many organisations, face the challenge of understanding and analysing complex environmental, economic, and social systems, due to the multi-dimensional nature of the questions they are seeking to answer. For example, EIT Food decision makers responsible for identifying which areas of food innovation to focus on to drive the mission must include in their opportunity and risk calculus both known and potential economic and policy changes and future scenarios, in an ever-changing climate and technology landscape. A complete approach may reduce the risk making partially informed business critical decisions, instead resulting in a higher ROI and attracting more investment from wider private and public sources.
In 2025, Earthbase and its development partners (Syndetic and OPF) will be seeking pilot candidates to test a new AI modelling environment containing various modules describing how different sectors of the economy interact with each other and the environment.
These 'modules' bridge the gap between economic, environmental, and technological policies, offering insights into the long-term consequences of different policy pathways. We believe that the pilot could rapidly test and prove the value for EIT Food:

Interdisciplinary modelling: We'd provide a framework where EIT Food can explore complex interactions across different sectors and policies relating to the issue they are dealing with, for example a startup seeking funding, as well as creating comprehensive models that include variables from related production systems and sectors: energy, product manufacturing, climate, agronomics, transportation, storage, waste, and so on
Decision-making support: EIT Food could simulate different policy scenarios and their impacts on a specific innovation area through their influence on the economy, the environment, and technology
High adaptability: we'd provide a toolset is tailored to EIT Food's specific needs and business processes/infrastructure
