OnePointFive (OPF) brings extensive expertise in environmental and social impact measurement, particularly in the healthcare sector. For Sanofi, OPF is positioned to support the quantification and communication of both environmental and social impacts in their Digital Healthcare (DHC) programs, including the Managed Patient Program (MPP) and Life Management Program (LMP). OPF has previously developed emissions models and assessed CSR impacts for Sanofi, such as for Type 2 Diabetes patient care pathways in Taiwan and Japan, where they identified significant emissions reductions from reduced doctor visits and hospitalizations. This work provides a foundation for developing similar strategies for the MPP and LMP programs, showcasing OPF’s capability to integrate sustainability metrics into healthcare solutions.

Additionally, OnePointFive excels in developing tailored data collection and impact modeling strategies, essential for capturing CSR-related data across various touchpoints in the MPP journey. OPF will leverage Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) principles and other methodologies to track environmental and social impacts, including emissions reductions from virtual care alternatives and improved patient engagement. OPF’s ability to build and adapt complex modeling systems is evidenced by their previous work with Sanofi, where they established data-driven frameworks for measuring healthcare solutions' emissions impacts and avoided emissions potential.

OnePointFive also demonstrates a strong capability in stakeholder engagement and cross-functional collaboration. In the MPP project, OPF will work closely with Sanofi teams and external digital healthcare partners to align data collection processes and ensure accurate CSR impact assessments. Their experience in conducting stakeholder interviews and gathering feedback, as seen in past collaborations with Sanofi, is crucial for refining data collection processes and ensuring that all necessary information is captured. This collaborative approach ensures that the outcomes are aligned with Sanofi’s broader goals of enhancing sustainability leadership in the healthcare sector.

Furthermore, OnePointFive has proven expertise in sustainability strategy development, having previously assisted Sanofi in embedding climate-related considerations into product and program development stages. OPF’s work includes designing CSR strategies and frameworks that integrate sustainability into the core operations of client businesses. For Sanofi, this will involve developing the necessary environmental and social indicators for both MPP and LMP, ensuring that their programs are not only compliant with sustainability expectations but also positioned to lead in the healthcare sector’s growing focus on sustainability.

Lastly, OnePointFive's experience with public communications and sustainability reporting will be vital in helping Sanofi share their environmental and social impact achievements with both internal and external audiences. OPF will guide Sanofi in translating complex impact data into actionable insights, which can be effectively communicated through executive-level reports and public disclosures. Their expertise in aligning with frameworks such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) further strengthens their ability to deliver clear, concise, and compliant reports that enhance Sanofi's reputation in the healthcare sector.

Through these capabilities, OnePointFive is well-equipped to help Sanofi drive sustainability outcomes in its MPP and LMP programs, positioning the company as a leader in the global healthcare sector's response to climate and social challenges.
