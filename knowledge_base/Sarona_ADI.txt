Date: 27 June 2024 Title: OPF ADI Climate Technical Assistance Support - v1.0 Prepared by 1.5degrees, LLC (d.b.a "OnePointFive") – CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL Not for Distribution
Our Understanding
Sarona Asset Management is responsible for managing the Australian Development Investments (ADI) fund, which provides 250 million AUD in funding for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in South and Southeast Asia and the Pacific, focused on climate mitigation and adaptation products and services. While Sarona has extensive experience as a leading impact investment firm focused on emerging markets, the fund seeks additional specialized support from a climate-focused consultancy that has familiarity with the APAC geographical region, capability, and staffing to work with fund managers on an individual basis, and expertise in capacity-building and upskilling.
This support would be delivered through a Technical Assistance (TA) Program, designed to build up fund managers' capabilities to develop and implement robust Environmental, Social and Governance Management Systems (ESGMSs) within their funds, and guide their portfolio companies to adopt best practice climate finance guidance, such as that provided by TCFD (which has formed the basis of the ISSB standards) and the ASEAN Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, and deliver climate impacts at scale.
OnePointFive is well-positioned to serve Sarona and its fund managers in upskilling and capacity building needs. OnePointFive is a listed and/or preferred vendor supporting TA services at climate funds within TPG Climate Rise & Y Analytics, MunichRe Ventures, and Autodesk Foundation, to name a few. Last year, OnePointFive worked with Sarona specifically to conduct a TCFD gap analysis, providing 30+ recommendations for Sarona to align its policies and investment processes to close identified gaps. We further conducted a climate risk assessment of the top countries in which Sarona's portfolio companies operate, identifying physical (i.e. natural disasters) and transition (i.e. policy & regulation, market trends) climate-related risks that Sarona should be cognisant of in developing a climate action plan.
OnePointFive has already worked with Sweef Capital, one of Sarona's funds, on several occasions. We conducted research and revised Sweef's approach for conducting climate due diligence across standard investment processes aligned to TCFD, Multilateral Development Banks, and EU SFDR guidelines. OnePointFive also produced sector-specific due diligence questionnaires and assessment reports across Education, Healthcare Services, Healthcare Products, and Food & CPG for Sweef to continue to implement its climate impact policies for portfolio companies operating in South and Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Lastly, we were closely involved with Sweef in developing and launching a report on integrating gender equality and climate action into investment strategies.
Beyond our TA climate services for fund managers, OnePointFive has >40 hrs of capacity & skills training content across 15 modules, including on GHG accounting and sustainability reporting & disclosures (e.g. ISSB, TCFD, etc.), which have been delivered to over 2,000 professionals. OnePointFive can leverage this climate training content, much of which is digitally recorded, to help upskill fund managers at scale.

A.4. Proposed TA Activities, Approach and Work Plan Detail your Proposed TA activities, working approach, methodology, and tools to be utilized by the applicant
We propose to begin each individual engagement with a discovery phase, to understand the extent of sustainability and impact work already underway, and where the particular fund manager may have gaps. We would utilize the ESGI gap assessment being carried out by Sarona as a starting point and if required, conduct a further needs assessment to narrow in on capability gaps, in particular those inhibiting funds from developing & executing on strategic climate initiatives aligned to ADI commitments.
The key outcome of this Discovery phase is to identify 2-4 priority TA activities per fund manager, based on where they have critical gaps, knowing they would each have distinct needs. We would develop an implementation plan for TA activities aligned to these 2-4 priority areas, to be carried out within 18 months of ADI's investment into a given fund.
The actual implementation timeline would depend on the TA activities selected, and contingent upon the timing of ADI's investment. Where there are common or similar gaps across several fund managers, we would streamline our TA activities where possible. For example, if the TA support is centered around GHG accounting, we would lead a workstream with a cohort of multiple fund managers, facilitating regular group check-ins, and providing opportunities for peer learning, sharing experiences and best practices. Throughout the 2-3 years of ADI's investments and resulting TA, we would project manage across the seven funds, utilizing our tried-and-true approaches to ensure the fund managers progress on their stated goals and objectives, while providing regular reporting and status updates to Sarona and ADI.
In the tables below we outline OPF's offerings that align with the RFP TA asks, and our work approach and methodology to carry out those offerings. These can be refined to ensure the project efforts remain within budget and scope.

B. Financial Proposal
Fixed Fee Estimate: Provide a fixed fee estimate based on the Proposed TA activities, expressed as the number of days by the daily rates in AUD.
B.1. Commercials
Note that the below are estimates of the days required (and associated fees) for proposed TA activities and work phases, aligned to OnePointFive's work to upskill and enhance capabilities of fund managers. The actual time spent by fund managers to complete their tasks (i.e., developing a policy) are not factored into these time estimates or costs.
The daily rate listed below is a weighted average across roles, based on anticipated time spent on the project, and with a 60% discount from our standard rates applied. We propose these rates aligned with DFAT's Value for Money principles like cost consciousness, proportionality, results focused, and accountable and transparent. Also, these rates will allow us to remain within budget, whilst providing valuable TA assistance. Time spent by the OnePointFive engagement team will likely vary week by week, but the commercial rates across phases will remain fixed, to ensure that we are delivering on project outcomes over time spent.
Below are detailed commercials. We will ensure that the overall commercials do not exceed the $60,000 AUD threshold per fund across Discovery Phase, 2-4 TA Priority Activities, and Project Management Support.
