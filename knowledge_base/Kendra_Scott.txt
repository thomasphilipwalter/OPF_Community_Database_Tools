OnePointFive has demonstrated strong capabilities in regulatory compliance and climate risk analysis, particularly in guiding organizations like Kendra Scott through complex climate regulations such as California Senate Bill 261 (SB 261) and Assembly Bill 1305 (AB 1305). Their experience in this area is reflected in their structured approach to supporting Kendra Scott with a baseline compliance framework and developing a repeatable process for future reporting cycles. This capability is reinforced by their previous work with Fortune 500 companies, where they provided actionable insights for compliance with climate-related regulations and helped clients meet their sustainability and reporting requirements.

In addition to regulatory compliance, OnePointFive excels in climate risk analysis, using both qualitative and quantitative methods to assess risks across the supply chain. For Kendra Scott, they plan to analyze climate-related physical risks (e.g., flooding, extreme weather events) and transition risks (e.g., policy changes, market shifts). Their approach integrates scenario analysis tools and climate risk software recommendations, drawing on their extensive experience with similar assessments for clients like Sarona Asset Management. This capability allows them to identify and quantify climate-related financial risks, which can then inform contingency planning and strategic decision-making, thereby reducing operational disruptions and increasing supply chain resilience.

OnePointFive also has robust expertise in climate strategy development, as seen in their previous work with clients like L’Oréal and Ruggable, where they integrated climate risk into broader business strategies. For Kendra Scott, they will use the TCFD framework to align the company’s climate strategy with the business's overall objectives, ensuring long-term resilience. This includes incorporating findings from the climate risk analysis into actionable business strategies that address both mitigation and adaptation efforts, aligned with governance and financial planning.

Further, OnePointFive brings significant experience in stakeholder engagement and training, as they have provided sustainability training to numerous organizations globally, including Cisco and MunichRe Ventures. Their climate fluency programs are designed to empower internal teams to effectively communicate sustainability strategies and manage compliance efforts. For Kendra Scott, they propose an optional training session to upskill their team on climate risk management and the specifics of AB 1305 and SB 261 compliance. This adds a layer of capacity building, ensuring that the team has the tools and knowledge to drive sustainability initiatives independently.

Finally, OnePointFive's data-driven approach ensures that all recommendations are backed by comprehensive research, utilizing publicly available climate risk data and climate scenarios. This is exemplified in their approach for Kendra Scott, where they plan to leverage open-source resources and perform in-depth analysis of physical and transition risks, providing Kendra Scott with a comprehensive understanding of the potential climate impacts on their business and supply chain. This methodical, data-driven approach positions OnePointFive as a trusted partner for helping organizations navigate the complexities of climate risk and regulatory compliance.
