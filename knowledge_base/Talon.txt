Project Brief for Talon's internal reference, April 2nd 2025
Executive Summary: ESG Support Project Brief
Situation Talon is embarking on its ESG journey, driven in part by investors, client credibility, and rising regulations. To date, ESG efforts have been led by Talon's UK team, which has led to initial efforts, like calculating Talon's organizations greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. Scope 1, 2, 3). Despite this, progress is relatively nascent.
Key Considerations Talon recently welcomed a FT sustainability manager to bolster capacity and capabilities to help progress ESG efforts. Talon's executive leadership is direction aligned to improve ESG metrics to improve Talon's investor positioning (e.g. with Equistone and others), credibility to clients; and to future-proof Talon from upcoming climate regulations, and material risks and opportunities.
Key Outcome Talon can leverage external expert support from OnePointFive to make effective, investor- and regulation-aligned progress on ESG. Third-party efforts will derisk Talon's ESG efforts by providing standards-aligned assurance to ESG measurements (e.g. GHGP Scope 1, 2, 3); and help accelerate progress - such as setting & approving science-based targets (with SBTi), responding to regulations (e.g. SECR, CSRD, etc.). This will set the foundation for Talon's first materiality assessment & ESG report

Rationale for ESG Focus For Marketing & Ad Agencies
In 2024-25, OnePointFive has worked with a global marketing agency BGB Group on their Scope 1, 2 (& 3) emissions) responding to vendor demand. We provided the below to support leadership buy-in for the work
Sustainability: Marketers' Ambition Outpaces Action Fueled by 88% of people across the US and UK who want brands to help them live more sustainable lives, recent Kantar research found that 90% of marketers believe sustainability agendas must be more ambitious. But, only 40% of marketing groups are at their infancy stage of incorporating sustainability practices into their organizations, providing a competitive advantage for those who act
Cutting Ad Emissions at the Source Fundamental to making progress and closing that gap between ambition and reality is understanding where an organization can have the greatest impact. AdGreen's annual review found that across over 2,733 advertising projects entered into its carbon calculator, travel and transport were found to be the highest emission sources, totaling 72% of emissions across all projects
Sustainability Drives Talent and Morale A survey of employed adults in 2023 found that 69% of employees want their companies to invest in sustainability efforts, including reducing carbon, using renewable energy, reducing waste, with the sentiment being even higher among the 18–34 age group. A further survey of 2,000 C-Suite found similar finding, plus benefits from brand recognition, reputation & customer satisfaction
Due to ESG action, BGB Group was able to respond to investor & vendor pressures, increase ESG ratings to secure new revenue tied to ESG progress & derisk cost of inaction

Customer Testimonials
Ralitsa Rizvanolli, Partner & Head of Investments "Working with OnePointFive has been exceptional. Their expertise, professionalism, and collaborative approach set them apart. OPF demonstrated a deep understanding of our needs and through their guidance, Sarona can sharpen its climate lens. We now understand better the climate opportunities and risks across our portfolio. As an investor in emerging markets, we espouse transparency and accountability. We engage in impact measurement and management with our investees. After working with OPF, Sarona is now confident and better equipped to develop its system for climate reporting and disclosures and align with evolving sustainability reporting standards for the private equity industry."
Former Head Of Strategic Partnerships, Munich Re Ventures "The knowledge experience of OPF's founders in the Carbon space was the key driver [to work together]. They've found a niche and very few in the space could have delivered a quality piece of work and display the level of versatility that this team did. By the end of the workshop, most folks were up to speed on the key elements of the space that were relevant to making business decisions on, and how to participate in the space going forward."
