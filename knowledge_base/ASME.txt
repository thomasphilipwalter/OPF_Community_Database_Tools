A. Our Understanding
From April to July 2022, OnePointFive conducted a three-month sprint with an ASME team, including desktop research & analysis of over 60 internal documents, 30 external sources from ASME and other engineering organizations; as well as 23 stakeholder interviews. This work sprint resulted in a climate strategy presentation & climate position statement workshop sessions - facilitated by Iana Aranda (ASME) & Neil Yeoh (OnePointFive) on behalf of the wider ASME & OnePointFive teams - at the Board of Governors Planning meeting in Houston on July 13th, 2022.
The key outcome of this project sprint was consensus from the ASME Board of Governors to prioritize the update of a public-facing, leadership-endorsed climate position statement to direct ASME's collective climate action into the future.

Figure #1: Highlights of the deliverables created during April to July 2022

[The document shows a visual representation of ASME Climate Position Statement including "ASME & Climate Change: Response & Strategy" dated Day #3: Wednesday, July 13, 2022 Board of Governors Planning Meeting Houston, Texas, along with implementation roadmap and considerations on volunteer governance]

The consensus from the board in the July meetings successfully solidified the need to ratify a refined public-facing climate position statement. While the board was unified in acknowledging that a forthcoming statement was necessary, there were differing perspectives and opinions to be accounted for and incorporated into the policy statement. Whilst ASME has been working internally to further refine the position statement to enable ratification and have also gained internal expert insight on governance model approach based on Phase #1, additional work is required to finalize the statement and decide the next phase of work around the governance model, and subsequent implementation plan.

As a result, the following proposal has been scoped, based on additional Phases Two and Three. See below for our proposed approach and plan to deliver the next phase of the ASME Climate Transition Strategy.

D. Our Commercials
To simplify costs and to operate cost-effectively for our customers, we work with our customers using a fixed monthly rate based on project scope, expected timeline, team resourcing requirements, and the complexity of a particular project or initiative. Our OnePointFive engagement team works closely with our customers' engagement team and key stakeholders to successfully deliver project work on time in line with the jointly agreed-upon project timeline and scope.
Hence, based on the two additional phases in the five-month scope of work above, resourcing requirements including core OnePointFive team members and experts, and anticipated multi-stakeholder engagement including stakeholder outreach / interviews - OnePointFive proposes a commercial rate of $45,000 for phase two, consisting of a 5 week sprint, and $35,000 per month for the third phase of this project - totaling $150,000 for work performed from August 29th 2022 to Feb 17th 2023. A work-phase decomposition and a further breakdown of costs associated with this discounted commercial rate are shown below (yellow for phase breakdown, teal for discounted rates, and gray for standard rates).
In order to meet this budget, timeline, and scope of work, the OnePointFive team will work closely as a team with the ASME engagement team to get inputs and support to streamline delivery of this project together.
