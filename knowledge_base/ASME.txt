OnePointFive demonstrates a strong capability in climate strategy development and advisory, as evidenced by their role in assisting ASME with refining their climate transition strategy. In Phase 1 of the project, OnePointFive led the development of a climate position statement, conducting in-depth research and stakeholder interviews. Their ability to synthesize insights from over 60 internal documents and 30 external sources enabled them to present a clear climate strategy to ASME's Board of Governors. This work also involved facilitating workshops, showcasing OnePointFive’s expertise in engaging stakeholders and aligning organizational vision with actionable climate goals.

The firm’s project management and coordination skills are clearly demonstrated in their work on the governance model and implementation plan. OnePointFive managed complex timelines, coordinating between various stakeholders, including ASME’s Board and staff. They facilitated key milestones such as the ratification of the climate position statement and the development of the governance model. Their structured approach included delivering materials, such as stakeholder engagement trackers and educational content for ASME’s climate governance model, ensuring smooth communication across teams.

OnePointFive has substantial expertise in stakeholder engagement and collaboration, which was critical to the success of the project. For example, in Phase 2, the team worked alongside ASME to build a governance framework for the Council on Sustainability (CoS) and Committee on Sustainability Management (CSM). This included developing roles, responsibilities, and an operations guide to streamline decision-making processes. OnePointFive’s ability to guide and shape the governance structure while ensuring alignment with ASME’s climate goals demonstrates their deep understanding of organizational design and sustainability governance.

The firm's financial modeling and budgeting capabilities were also a key asset in supporting ASME’s climate transition strategy. OnePointFive developed a refined implementation plan with financial models for proposed climate initiatives, including cost-benefit analyses and success metrics. Their work in aligning financial modeling with strategic climate initiatives for FY24-26 ensured that the climate action plans were both feasible and measurable.

Finally, OnePointFive’s educational and training expertise was central to developing the necessary tools for ASME's internal teams. They designed and facilitated workshops on climate governance, providing ASME with essential resources for onboarding new governance members. By creating training materials and guiding workshops, OnePointFive empowered ASME’s leadership to drive climate action internally, reinforcing the firm’s competency in capacity-building for sustainability initiatives.
