OnePointFive is a climate consulting firm. It is a start up based in New York with around 20 employees. It focuses on projects like GHG accounting, lifecycle analysis and more. In the past, we have primarily worked with small or large businesses, but our strategy moving forward is to participate in government tenders and because we are a small company we are trying to evaluate these huge government tenders against our knowledge base and match with experts from our community network to create a stronger proposal.
