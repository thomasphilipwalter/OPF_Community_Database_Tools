OnePointFive has proven expertise in managing complex, multi-stakeholder projects, as shown by their leadership role in the PMO for the "Net Zero Beef Supply Chain Prototype" project. They have successfully executed similar PMO functions in past climate-related projects, ensuring effective project management from initiation through execution. The company utilizes best practices in project setup, communication, and milestone tracking, and applies proven strategies for stakeholder alignment and coordination. OnePointFive’s ability to track progress and manage resources efficiently contributes to project success, even when navigating competing priorities or delays.

In the realm of GHG accounting and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), OnePointFive excels in the development and application of methodologies that adhere to international standards such as the GHG Protocol and ISO 14000. Their expertise is reflected in their work for clients like FMC, Accenture, and Sanofi, where they developed bespoke GHG emissions models and LCA tools. These models provided comprehensive insights into Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, while also helping clients align their emissions reduction goals with established frameworks such as the Science-Based Targets Initiative. OnePointFive’s ability to deliver precise and tailored GHG accounting solutions is further exemplified by their work on digital healthcare solutions, where they integrated GHG calculations with social and medical outcomes to inform sustainability strategies.

OnePointFive is also highly skilled in facilitating expert workshops and stakeholder consultations to build consensus and align project objectives. For the "Net Zero Beef Supply Chain Prototype," they are tasked with developing the allocation methodology for GHG footprints across beef supply chains. They will conduct literature reviews, frame workshops, and use expert input to refine this methodology. OnePointFive’s experience in facilitating such workshops ensures that all key stakeholders’ perspectives are integrated into the development of robust and scientifically sound methodologies.

Furthermore, OnePointFive is proficient in sensitivity analysis and modeling for GHG accounting systems. The company is applying this expertise in the current project by testing and refining the allocation model through initial data testing and sensitivity analysis. This ensures that the methodology developed is both reliable and adaptable, providing accurate results even with changing data inputs or assumptions. Their use of sensitivity analysis to evaluate model robustness showcases their analytical rigor and attention to detail in complex environmental modeling.

Finally, OnePointFive demonstrates its commitment to capacity building and knowledge transfer through its comprehensive training programs. By integrating training sessions into their project deliverables, they ensure that EIT Food staff and project stakeholders are equipped with the knowledge to manage future GHG accounting processes and methodologies independently. This emphasis on training not only enhances the long-term sustainability of their solutions but also strengthens the client's internal capabilities in managing future projects.
