1-Pager Project Proposal Brief
Project Context & Objective PMO & GHG Accounting Methodology Project
	•	FAI & Standard Soil are launching a 18-month multi-stakeholder project split over two phases aimed at transforming how the carbon footprint of beef is quantified in the supply chain. The goal is to move beyond generic estimates to verifiable data from real farms, ranches, and supply chains. This project is critical for companies with beef or beef by-products in their Scope 3 emissions, offering the potential to significantly cut the emissions from beef through improved production processes. Key project activities include running a project management office (PMO), developing methods to quantify beef GHG footprint improvements, exploring tracing technologies, and creating a robust GHG accounting system to allocate footprint data accurately across beef supply chains. This project proposal focuses on the first phase of the project spanning roughly eight months.
	•	FAI & Standard Soil are seeking OnePointFive (OPF) to lead the Project Management Office (PMO) for the project and to contribute their climate expertise to developing the draft GHG accounting beef allocation methodology as part of the phase one project objectives. OPF is a New York-headquartered climate consulting & training company with deep expertise in running PMO for multi-stakeholder climate-related projects, and building GHG accounting and LCA modeling in compliance with the GHG Protocol & ISO14000s Standards respectively (see VII.

Overall PMO Strategy & Approach
A project management office (PMO) is responsible for guidance, documentation and metrics related to the practices surrounding the management and implementation of a project. Within these responsibilities, a PMO should make sure that a project is managed effectively from start-to-end to a successful and timely completion. OnePointfive's (OPF) has had past experience running PMO and providing consulting support for several high-profile climate-technical projects (see VII. Relevant Case Studies). From this experience, there are several general PMO strategies, tools & practices that we believe should be applied for a project to be successfully managed from start to finish (see table below). As the PMO for this project, we would ensure these are setup using templates & learnings from past projects we have managed.
PMO Strategy, Tools & Practices by Project Phase | OPF visual examples

	•	Project document management, and clear version control principles
	•	Escalation process for dependencies & behind schedule items
Review
	•	Final deliverables review process & deadline adherence
	•	Project deliverable presentations and handover
Additionally, there are specific risks & mitigation strategies we've identified as a PMO for climate-related projects that should also be considered (see table below). From our past project experience, it has become apparent that having a PMO with climate domain expertise and direct involvement within appropriate project stream(s) is best-practice. Consistently across the projects we have managed, there are always climate-specific blockers & support that require a PMO (and/or other project stakeholders) with technical climate expertise to resolve. For example, with respect to bespoke GHG accounting modeling, there are key assumptions that need to be made that require technical understanding of GHG accounting standards (i.e. GHG Protocol, ISO14000s). As the PMO, we have had to help provide research & project support, acting as the climate expert guide to help stakeholders align on key assumptions to progress through project milestones like these.
Climate-specific project risks | Mitigation strategies employed by OPF
Stakeholders involved are unfamiliar with the technical aspects of the climate project scope - e.g. GHG Protocol Accounting Standards to ISO14000s on Life Cycle Assessment
	•	Providing climate training* via pre-readings & learning resources
	•	Ensuring input among key stakeholders with climate technical expertise to align with other stakeholders
	•	Having PMO supporting directly within select project streams to address competency gaps
Deprioritization of climate project due to competing priorities, specifically as many climate initiatives are additional to day-to-day work responsibilities
	•	Aligning upfront with stakeholders on expected involvement and scheduling
	•	Providing clear estimates as to what the work entails, including time requirements
	•	Communicating the return on investment and climate impact
Delays in correspondence including data & information collection among project stakeholders, due to various reasons such as: organizational bureaucracy, sensitive data or information request, multi-stakeholder availabilities and meeting scheduling
	•	Frontloading data & information collection, including anticipating delays
	•	Allocating additional time for data & information collection within project plan
	•	Setting up & aligning on an escalation process for dependencies & behind schedule items
	•	Pre-alignment on stakeholders critical for project, and scheduling meetings ahead of time
Stakeholders have competing feedback & opinions on project deliverables, acknowledging there are various input and methodological assumptions required for bespoke GHG accounting & LCA modeling exercises
	•	Align on review process, stakeholder governance and expected approval processes
	•	Pre-scheduling strategic touchpoints with key stakeholders & decision-makers
	•	Frontloading project deliverable deadlines to accommodate review time
*OnePointFive has 15 dedicated, tried-and-tested climate training & education modules - including but not limited to food & ag, GHG accounting to LCA modeling - to help stakeholders and organizations to get up to speed on core industry/sector and netzero-related topics.
Phase 1C: Allocation Protocol Development
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a robust accounting system to quantify and apply GHG footprints for beef, utilizing MMRV solutions, tracing technology, and an allocation methodology to allocate impact to production throughput for the entire fabricated carcass of beef and beef by-products.
Choosing an allocation rule will be an important step, and will require consensus from the key project stakeholders. Existing studies such as that of Wilfart et al. (2021) were unable to choose a single "best" allocation rule based on scientific and technical arguments alone, as each method has its own consequences, but did recommend practices for applying either economic or biophysical allocation to minimize disagreements across stakeholders.
The methodology should also cover a variety of agricultural improvements – such as those likely to have the most emissions reduction potential, and those that are easiest to implement. For example, proposed strategies to reduce CH4 and N2O emissions include: reducing livestock density, improving feed availability and quality, improving animal health, inhibiting methanogenesis, such as through feed additives, and manure digesters. For CO2 emissions, solutions include capitalizing on nature-based solutions to sequester carbon and generate carbon insets / offsets, such as through biochar, agroforestry, and soil amendments. Below is an illustrative example process flow of how the methodology could be developed, subject to input from FAI, Soil Carbon, and other project partners.

Preliminary Thinking on Project Risks
The proposal prepared by FAI Farms and Standard Soil rightfully highlighted multiple complex issues that would require consideration and resolution to successfully develop a practical methodology solution, such as having to balance and negotiate across stakeholders with conflicting political interests, in part driven by the implications of different allocation methods. In addition to the issues already mentioned, several more risks come to mind based on OnePointFive's research and understanding of the industry. These challenges, while significant, are not insurmountable; they should be proactively managed, turning them into opportunities for refinement and success.
	•	Variability in farming practices: Beef production practices vary widely globally and even regionally. This variability affects GHG emissions, making it challenging to develop a one-size-fits-all methodology. Practices like regenerative grazing and feed additives show promise but need to be adapted to different environmental and economic contexts. Overall, this project should emphasize accurately measuring outcomes, and identifying practice-agnostic metrics, rather than relying on existing emission models which are tied to specific practices.
	•	Over-reliance on soil carbon sequestration: Soil carbon sequestration offers promise but has notable limitations that must be accounted for in methodological development. Wang et al. (2023) identified significant challenges in utilizing this approach for mitigating emissions in the beef industry, primarily due to soil's limited carbon storage capacity, which eventually reaches a saturation point. While their study raises concerns about the longevity of carbon storage, it is limited in its scope, focusing on the top 30 cm of soil. The study also finds that, at maximum efficiency, soil carbon sequestration can offset emissions equivalent to approximately 1.25 cows per hectare of grassland. Since current animal densities are far too high to meet this threshold, the methodology developed through this project should still incorporate this solution with a realistic weighting or consideration, but should also emphasize other reduction techniques. Ongoing literature review will further assess the feasibility and integration of soil carbon sequestration in our approach.
	•	Defining "waste" in the allocation methodology: Wilfart et al. (2021) outline the subjective classification of "waste" versus by-products in the cattle supply chain, which can affect the allocation of environmental impacts in LCAs. They note that any allocation approach besides the economic rule may assign a high proportion of impact to a low-value product (i.e, nearly a waste product). Regardless of whether the methodology uses a more economic or biophysical approach, a clear and consistent definition of "waste" that accounts for variations in by-product utilization across different farms should be established.
	•	Dynamics of using certain allocation methods: The choice of allocation methodology can have unintentional consequences in the supply chain. For instance, Wilfart et al. (2021) point out that utilizing economic allocation can inadvertently prioritize by-products with higher market value, potentially obscuring environmental benefits and drawbacks of less valuable by-products. This approach may lead to incentivizing the production of certain by-products over others or impacting the perceived environmental performance of the supply chain. Considering these dynamics can ensure that the allocation methodology reflects true environmental impacts and does not skew incentives or reporting.
	•	Gaps in existing literature: A comprehensive literature review conducted by Kyttä et al. (2021) revealed that a significant number of studies fail to adequately incorporate by-products such as manure, hides, and bones in their LCA allocation methodologies. The lack of data and standards for allocating by-product emissions could pose a challenge in the development of the methodology.
	•	Potential conflict with other active MRV projects: Thanks in large part to recent USDA's Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities project grants and IRA funding, there are many related MRV projects underway at research institutions across the US. Working with these institutions can be useful to gather insights, but may also result in conflicting reports / methodologies being developed for the beef supply chain, and/or difficulty in getting buy-in from stakeholders across the industry. It will be imperative to carve out the key goals of this project, and how it plans to build upon existing studies, or diverge from them.

Proposed Approach for Phase 1A: MMRV Evaluation
Should FAI Farms and Standard Soil request OnePointFive's support on Phase 1A, below is a proposed approach for supporting the first two components, specifically to compile a list of existing MMRV technologies, companies, and organizations, and synthesize that list into a small subset. This would be handed over to another project partner for the subsequent components of phase 1A, such as the testing plan development & execution.
OnePointFive has extensive experience conducting landscape assessments for customers (see VII. Relevant Case Studies); these projects typically include researching industry peers and market trends, aligning on evaluation criteria, and providing recommendations based on that research. For this particular project, OnePointFive would generate an exhaustive list of existing MMRV solution technologies, companies and organizations; develop criteria for evaluation; vet these providers (for review by FAI, Soil Carbon, and project stakeholders); and subsequently identify a subset of 3-5 solution providers to prioritize for pilot testing.
Examples (not-exhaustive) of scaling or commercialized MMRV solutions include:
