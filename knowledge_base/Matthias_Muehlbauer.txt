Professional Summary
I am a startup advisor, climate entrepreneur, writer, Co-Founder and COO at OnePointFive, helping drive OnePointFive's strategy, advisory work and I am a lead facilitator for the OnePointFive Academy.
On LinkedIn, I attempt to demystify climate by distilling insights from our advisory work, and the expert speakers we host on the OPF Academy.
I have 10 years experience working across Australian, Japanese and US markets in consulting and entrepreneurship roles and have spoken at COP28, Yale University and New York University on the intersection of Business & Climate. I've previously been a World Economic Forum contributor writing on ESG investment and innovative climate solutions, and as an advisor, have advised startups and innovation through Plug & Play's Sustainability vertical, the CleanTech Open, and the UN Reboot the Earth Hackathon.
I'm currently exploring the Future of the Climate Workforce and its implications for corporate sustainability, and have been diving into how corporates are transforming their organizations to better embed sustainability.
