opf.degree
OnePointFive is a climate solutions company focused on helping organizations transition to sustainable pathways and achieve net-zero emissions.
Climate Challenge
It's Getting HOT in Here
The urgency of climate action is clear - global temperatures are rising and immediate action is required.
Implications of Our Current Pathway
We are currently on a 4+ degrees Celsius warming pathway, where future sustainable growth is at severe risk without proactive action onto a 1.5 degrees Celsius "OnePointFive" pathway.
Climate scenario pathways show greenhouse gases over time, with two trajectories:
	•	4+ degrees Celsius pathway (continuing upward)
	•	1.5 degrees Celsius pathway (declining after initial rise)
Vision and Mission
Our Vision
"A planet free of all excess greenhouse gas emissions generated by human activity, safeguarding earth for current and future generations"
OnePointFive's name is based on 1.5 degrees Celsius (or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), which is the global temperature warming limit from pre-industrial times to avoid global climate catastrophe, according to the United Nations' IPCC.
The Challenges Our Customers Face
	•	Capacity Constraints: "We're busy, and have more work and initiatives than our team can handle."
	•	Expertise Gaps: "We don't have the climate expertise, training, or in-house talent to get things done."
	•	Bespoke Needs: "Many of our climate needs are bespoke, not justifying full-time hires."
	•	Selecting Solutions: "There are many 'solutions' out there, but we need ones that work for us."
Our Purpose
We believe the climate crisis can be solved by deploying the best of human ingenuity through:
	•	Project Teams
	•	Expert Network (500+ experts)
Our Approach

Green Skills Statistics
Around the world, only one in eight workers has one or more green skills. Put another way, seven in eight workers lack even a single green skill.
Between 2022 and 2023, the share of green talent in the workforce rose by a median of 12.3% while the share of job postings requiring at least one green skill grew twice as quickly — by a median of 22.4%.
The five-year annualized growth rate between 2018 and 2023 reveals a similar trend. The share of green talent grew by 5.4% per year over that period, while the share of jobs requiring at least one green skill grew by 9.2%.
Even as overall hiring slowed over the past year, green hiring bucked that trend. While overall hiring slowed globally between February 2022 and February 2023, job postings requiring at least one green skill have grown by a median of 15.2% over the same period.
The median LinkedIn hiring rate for workers with at least one green skill is 29% higher than the workforce average.

New Brand Case Study Template
Features color palette with primary colors (sea grass, mist, earth, lime, horizon) and accent colors (earth, lime, horizon), plus neutral colors (off white, grey, cedar, pine).
Vibrant and saturated tones create an optimistic energy that inspires viewers. Sea Grass, Mist, Earth, Lime and Horizon lead as primary colors and create a palette that feels earthy yet bright. They connect back to the brand's core value of optimism and growth. Cedar and Pine act as secondary colors that feel grounded and safe. Sea Grass, Lime, and Pine are all fresh interpretations of green that are classically associated with sustainability initiatives.
