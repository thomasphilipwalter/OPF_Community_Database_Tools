OnePointFive (OPF) excels in delivering specialized climate training and facilitation. OPF's capability to provide impactful climate education is demonstrated through the proposed series of workshops, speaking engagements, and investor training sessions planned for June 2–6. These sessions, led by Neil Yeoh, will cover essential topics like circular economy principles, green engineering, and climate finance and reporting. OPF's focus on practical and investor-centered learning outcomes highlights its ability to engage participants in hands-on, real-world applications. Additionally, the company will support the integration of session materials into the Sweef KINETIK's LMS, ensuring continued engagement beyond the live sessions.

The firm has proven expertise in supporting startups with climate impact measurement and communication. OPF will partner with Sweef KINETIK to provide tailored technical assistance to up to six startups. This includes guiding them through Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and green engineering principles to assess their environmental and carbon impacts. By focusing on impact reporting, OPF helps entrepreneurs improve their climate credibility and investment readiness, preparing them to effectively communicate their sustainability efforts to investors, customers, and the broader market.

OnePointFive also demonstrates strong capabilities in building ecosystems for climate investment. In collaboration with Sweef KINETIK, OPF will engage with Indonesian universities to connect environmental studies students with startups in need of LCA and green engineering expertise. The company will also facilitate relationships with Indonesian investors and integrate them into the Australian Development Investment network to co-develop pathways for gender-responsive climate capital deployment. This reflects OPF’s ability to map ecosystems, identify gaps, and develop actionable implementation roadmaps that scale investment opportunities for local entrepreneurs, particularly in underserved regions.

Through these activities, OnePointFive showcases its strategic approach to combining capacity-building, technical expertise, and ecosystem development to drive impactful and scalable climate solutions across emerging markets.
