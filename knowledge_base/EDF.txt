Training Context

To enhance the 2025 fellowship program, EDF seeks to develop a hands-on workshop focused on "Advocating for Change" - equipping fellows with practical skills to navigate organizational dynamics and implement sustainability initiatives effectively.
OnePointFive & Andiamo Advisory (Engagement Team) will partner to design and deliver a specialized 75-minute live virtual workshop that combines proven change management frameworks with real-world sustainability implementation strategies.

OnePointFive Academy: Upskilling Climate Professionals Through a Cohort-Based Virtual Curriculum
OnePointFive has developed a 8-week virtual climate curriculum to upskill professionals entering the climate sector, that we call the OnePointFive Academy (OPFA). Analyzing survey data, we identified the top 6 climate-specific topics and designed >25 hours of content covering GHG accounting, climate strategy, life cycle assessment, reporting, and professional skills. We deliver 3 cohorts of the program every year, and are currently delivering our sixth iteration of the program.
Our testimonials indicate that our 700+ strong OPFA alumni community, from across 45 countries, have enjoyed the precisely tailored content, supportive community, and practical applicability of the curriculum. Many alumni have stated that the program has had a significant impact on their careers, with some securing new climate jobs and others identifying opportunities to collaborate on sustainability projects within the community. The data visualized above reinforces these testimonials, showing dramatic increases in fellows' self-reported knowledge across key sustainability topics.
OPF Academy Fellows Were Asked To Rate Their Knowledge On:
	•	Net Zero Strategy & Decarbonization: Before 2.35, After OPF Academy 4.10 (+92%)
	•	GHG Accounting & Life Cycle Analysis: Before 2.09, After OPF Academy 4.00 (+91%)

Climatebase Fellowship: Upskilling Sustainability Professionals
Since 2021, we have developed and delivered six remote cohort-based climate curricula to upskill and train professionals working in sustainability and climate roles, through the Climatebase Fellowship. Analyzing survey data from thousands of professionals, we identified the top seven climate topics and skill sets sought by employers and organizations, namely: Climate Fundamentals, Energy & Transportation, Engineered Carbon Removal, Nature Based Solutions, Food & Agriculture, Circular Economy, Building Cities & Adaptation, and Sustainability Professionals.
Over the course of an eight-week fellowship, we deliver 12 hours of climate curriculum through weekly virtual sessions to over 2000+ professionals globally. The program includes moderated panels and deep-dives with industry leaders, providing participants with a strong foundation across a range of climate business opportunities.
